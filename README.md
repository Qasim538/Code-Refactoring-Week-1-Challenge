# Code-Refactoring

### Week One Challenge

## Project Description:

This is our first challenge and we need to work on a stater code a Digital Marketing Agency Website to reorder and make it easy for the users and for other coders who will work in the future.


## Approach:

# HTML:
I have taken help from different online platforms to understand Semantic Tags and try to use them throughout this website to make it more understandable. And I also added alt attributes to understand missing elements incase something went wrong with the website or any browser fail to render images. 


# CSS:
I have tried to keep my css coding to as minimum as possible by merging h2 headline and reordered them to their own groups to make it easy to select a section to alter or amend in the future. 


# Amends:
Right hand column was long so taken away few spaces back to bring it to bottom level in css. 
Added alt atrtibues to html.
Added Symantic tags to html.
Added id to the first headline so it can be interactive like other two.
Changed cursore to pointer.
Reduced and merged few coding where needed.


# Techenologies:
This project was built with HTML and CSS but bit of JavaScript to keep navbar interactive.


# Responsiveness:
I tried to make it responsive but the css was built in old style, not using flexbox. So, leaving as it is as it was made for Desktop verson but in future we can use flexbox and make it responsive.


## Deploy:
I deploy this website by using GitHub commands (Git Clone, git add., git push) link


## License:
I have added a MIT license.
